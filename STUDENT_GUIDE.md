## 🎭 Emotion Tracking (What You Need to Know)

### How It Works:
- Every 60 seconds during meeting
- Face-API detects your facial expressions
- Tracks 7 emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful, Disgusted, Neutral
- Measures your attentiveness level
- No photos or videos saved (just emotion data)

### Why It Matters:
- Helps lecturer understand class engagement
- Identifies when students are confused
- Improves teaching methods
- Part of your participation grade

### What You'll See:
- Small indicator when emotion detected
- "Face detected" message in console (if you check)
- No visible scores or alerts on your screen

### Lecturer Sees:
- Overall class mood
- Individual engagement levels
- When students seem confused or disengaged
- Alerts for low attentiveness

### Tips for Best Results:
- Face the camera directly
- Ensure good lighting
- Stay visible in camera frame
- Stay engaged and focused

## 📊 Attendance Tracking

### How Attendance Works:

**Automatic Recording:**
1. When you join meeting → Record join time
2. When you leave meeting → Record leave time
3. If you rejoin → New session recorded
4. Total duration calculated automatically

### Attendance Status:

**Based on Meeting Duration:**
- **Present**: Attended >75% of meeting
- **Partial**: Attended 50-75% of meeting
- **Absent**: Attended <50% of meeting

   - Status

### Multiple Sessions:
If you leave and rejoin:
- Session 1: First join → first leave

- Total duration = Sum of all sessions

### Attendance Tips:

- Stay for full meeting duration
